                <h1>Matt Harkins, Software Engineer</h1>
                <strong><small>Python Programmer -- Full Stack Enginner -- Application Developer</small></strong>
                <p>I am currently enrolled in an immersive bootcamp to gather the skills necessary to handle a variety of software engineering needs. I am becoming familiar with technologies covering front and back end development, as well as data science.
                I'm actively engaged with technologies such as Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>

                <h1>My Background</h1>
                <strong><small>Accounting -- Financial Services</small></strong>
                <p>My love for programming started back in my accounting days when I was 21 (2008). A large part of my job was building and maintaing sophistated Excel spreadsheets that needed to perform a variety of functions. I thoroughly enjoyed taking an idea from concept to reality within this program for both accounting and operational needs. People advised along the way that I should seriously consider getting into programming, but unfortunately I didn't listen at the time. In 2016, I decided to move on
                    and get a start in the insurance business as an agent/financial representative. There were some things I enjoyed about this career, but I couldn't get away from my base passion which was programming. I really missed the Excel stuff, but didn't want to go back into accounting. I decided it was take to jump into the world of software engineering and I definitely see this is where I belong.</p>

                <h1>Other Things About Me</h1>
                <strong><small>Family -- Fitness -- Podcasts --Meditation</small></strong>
                <p>First and foremost I love spending time with my family. Whether it's just hanging out watching shows, camping, or going on a long vacation there isn't anything that can compare to the enjoyment I have with my family. I am also really big on self development. On the fitness side, I'm an avid weight trainer (athletic lifting not bulk) and doing some MMA training. I don't actually fight MMA, but I do get a lot out of the training. I am also really big on recovery work such as inversion therapy, massage,
                    infrared sauna, ice baths, and foundation training. Nutrition is of course a big part of all this too but there's a lot to unpack there. Most of it comes down to ketogenic cycling, time-restricted eating, and of course tracking. I enjoy learning so podcasts are a big part of my day. I don't listen to music much so I typically will have one on when I'm driving. I also try to find other leisure times to listen to one, and for some of them I even just sit and takes notes because the information is so great.
                    Something that I've really been into for about 3 years now is meditation. The type that I practice is mindfulness meditation, otherwise known as vipassana. I started doing this with the help up a guided mediation app called Waking Up, by Sam Harris. I'd say it has pretty much changed my life which sounds strange but try mindfulness daily for a few months and tell me the world doesn't just subtly seem different to you. Here is a link to learn more if you're interested:  <a href="https://wakingup.com/">wakingup.com</a>. I also plan on taking a meditation retreat in the near future.</p>
